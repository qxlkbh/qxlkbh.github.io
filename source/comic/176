[LC pops into the main universe]<br><br>
LC: "nice to be back in Citygradville at last..."<br><br>
LC (approaching the mayoral office, which has "interim" painted sloppily above "mayor"): "I'm sure I didn't miss anything major"<br><br>
LC: "Nothing Citygradville-related has happened in recent comics"<br><br>
LC: (tempting fate) "... and goodness knows to hide something major we'd need a more effective fourt--"<br>
???: "Hello La Croix."<br><br>
??? (revealed to be The Fourth Wall by swiveling around in the mayoral chair): "I've been waiting for you."
