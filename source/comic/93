I mean, this isn't entirely fair. At least usually the backstory is actually remotely relevant to the story in like actual comics. But like, I saw a joke to make, so I made it, ya know?
<br />
Also re: title text: this was a conscious choice I made specifically; LC is annoying to draw by qxlkbh standards so it would have been easier just to draw noncanon-human-past-la-croix doing something rather than la croix. But yeah.
<br />
Also hooray I guess la croix just made fanfiction or something. I guess for qxlkbh it's always good that our canon is growing more tangled and hard to follow.
<br />
(But yeah what LC is saying here <em>isn't</em> canon. Canonically.)
<br />
In retrospect I feel like I was missing a joke about matrices or something but like whatever.
<br />
Also wow that's a lot of commentary.

<h3>a general note about the subgenre discussed</h3>
I feel like this could be construed as an attack on instances of transformation media where there's no transformation that ever happens within the span of the actual work. To be honest, though, these are pretty rare but seem like they're generally better executed on average. This is probably because:<br>
<ul>
<li> transformation media involves the trope of gender bending more often than it seems that it should
<li> due to the principle of Author Appeal this tends to mean the author either wants to address something related (directly or indirectly) to transgender issues/has such on their mind at least, OR is out to make something, erm, a little less wholesome. (sometimes there's a third option where they're unknowingly writing trans allegory and have no idea they are but I'll consider than part of "on their mind")
<li> the specific subgenre where transformation doesn't happen onscreen is much better suited to the trans allegory side of things that than the creepy side of things. And even among its side , this specifically generally seems to be fairly well written, too. Maybe it's that it's a little less wish fulfillment-y? Don't get me wrong, it's fine for people to have their wish fulfillment stuff (especially when they're part of a very oppressed minority etcetera) and I'm glad it exists, but it can often end up feeling a bit one-note. I find [the subgenre I discussed her] tends to take things in more unique directions in the instances I've encountered it.
</ul>
I dunno I'm sure other people have differing opinions ("musija you have terrible taste because I think all the wish fulfillment fluff is really wholesome!!" etcetera).
