fourth wall: "I must concede: you're quite good at swordplay"<br><br>
fourth wall: "this swordfight has gone bafflingly long even though our weapons are clearly mismatched. And neither of us has yet drawn blood."<br><br>
LC: "Heh. 'drawn blood', you say?"<br><br>
[LC swings their sword and the blade flies off, revealing that it's also a paintbrush underneath; they select a hue and then a lightness which are approximately the color of blood]<br><br>
fourth wall [quietly]: "oh no."<br><br>
LC [leaping at the fourth wall] "time to BREEAAAK YOU!!!!"
