<!--wow, really "incensed" in the last transcription? you little INJOKE you.-->LC [written in lowercase but the sentiment is definitely capitalized]: "hjaargh!" [they leap at the fourth wall, who swings their claymore or whatever to meet LC's rapier]<br><br>
SFX: [ABRUPT SCENE CHANGE]<br>
zvïklïng [reclining in a chair whilst reading this very comic, speaking to themself in english]: "ugh, seriously? a scene change NOW? What a cop-out."<br><br>
[several other characters come along, two carrying a rock and a third walking along with them]<br>
xat [in qxøxøpa]: "oh, zvïklïng! How are you? How are you able to relax these days when the zVillainsrg demand we all help build their tower?"<br><br>
zvïklïng [sitting up in chair, speaking qxøxøpa (probably as snobbishly as possible)]: "heh. well let's just say they aren't above granting their translator some favors."
