<p>Originally I wrote zalicerg's last line in the first panel by accident as "see any you like." with a period, which sure is a very interesting command to give someone. It's very strange to instruct people to do a passive action like that. Though, I mean, sometimes you DO command people to "see" things (e.g. "see fig. 1" or more dubiously "see here" which is kind of more a set phrase I guess) but I think the "any you like" just makes things even weirder here, since naturally in this context it's not possible to form an opinion on them until you've already seen them. I think that's why this command is slightly more nonsensical than other commands to "see" things.<br><br> Anyway, this is why the title text is what it is.</p>
