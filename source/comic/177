LC [incensed]: "YOU? What do you think you're doing in my office?"<br><br>
The Fourth Wall [reclining]: "why, I'm the interim mayor acting in your stead!"<br><br>
LC: "this is absurd! I'd never have approved you to act on my behalf!"<br>
The Fourth Wall [standing out of chair]: "Sure, but you'd be surprised what friends in high places can do for you."<br><br>
LC: "fine. Well, seeing as I'm back, get out of my office, please."<br>
The Fourth Wall: "Nah, not feeling it."<br><br>
LC [drawing rapier]: "let's try again. please leave my office."<br><br>
The Fourth Wall [drawing greatsword]: "nice rapier. Hey, what do you think of my greatsword?"<br>
