<p>other actions that were considered for the title text:
<ul><li>launder my meds</li>
<li>check on the teeth in the oven</li>
<li>shave my teeth</li>
<li>feed my petunias</li>
<li>unclog my oven</li>
<li>descale my iguana</li>
</ul>

Nota bene: so in #167 the background is inverted, but in #168 it is not. This was an error on my (musija's) part in 168, but I don't know, retroactively maybe colors are only inverted when out in space, or something.</p>
